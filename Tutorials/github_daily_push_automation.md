## INTRODUCTION
This GitHub Actions workflow was designed to automate a daily commit, allowing the user to maintain a streak of continuous commits on GitHub without interruption. This regular process, which can avoid forgetting a daily update, contributes to the visibility of the user's activity on their GitHub profile.  
The workflow is scheduled to run automatically every day using a cron trigger under the schedule field. Alternatively, it can also be triggered manually with workflow_dispatch.

## CONFIGURATION
### Create a repository
Choose an explicit name like "DailyPush".  

‚ö†Ô∏è Set it to public visibility if you use an activity or streak tracking plugin like [GitHub Streak].  

Setup your action in your new repository =>  
DailyStreakAutomation > Settings > Actions > General  
- "Allow all actions and reusable workflows"
- "Require approval for first-time contributors"
- "Read and write permissions"  

Save each sections!

### Create the workflow
Create a workflow folder call "DailyPush":
```powershell
mkdir -p "$env:USERPROFILE\DailyPush\.github\workflows"
```
Create a file named init.vim:
```powershell
New-Item -Path "$env:USERPROFILE\DailyPush\.github\workflows\daily_push.yaml" -ItemType File
```
Copy and paste the "raw" file content of this [daily_push.yaml](https://github.com/EmmanuelLefevre/DailyPush/blob/main/.github/workflows/daily_push.yml) file into yours...  

üí° The markdown log file streak.md will be created by the workflow if it does not already exist...

### Setup the email repository secret
‚ö†Ô∏è Exposing your email in a YAML file (especially in a public repository) is risky!  

DailyStreakAutomation > Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > New repository secret
