## INTRODUCTION
Assign mouse shortcuts without builder software!  

⚠️ Your mouse must have several buttons apart from the classic ones...

## PROCEDURE
1. Download AutoHotkey => [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)

2. Install it with the exe file...  

3. Launch program => **AutoHotkey Dash**  

4. "New script" button.  

5. Give a name to your script file, like "mouse_shorcuts". AutoHotkey will create the file for you, this one will have ".ahk" file extension.  

6. Copy/paste this inside:
```shell
; Assign CTRL+C to button B4
XButton1::Send ^c

; Assign CTRL+V to button B5
XButton2::Send ^v
```
7. Double click on the file to launch the script.  

## 😍 BONUS 😍
Automate script at startup.  

1. Right click on your "mouse_shortcuts.ahk" file > Create shortcut  

2. Right click on the shortcut > Cut  

3. Windows + R
```shell
shell:startup
```
4. Paste you shortcut file inside.  

5. ⚠️ Add an exception in your anti-virus for the "mouse_shortcuts.ahk" file, because it's not uncommon for an antivirus to detect AutoHotkey scripts as potentially suspicious.

Well it's done, the script will be launch at startup 🤙
